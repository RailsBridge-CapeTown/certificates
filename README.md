certificates
============

Course completion certificates

The `generator` folder contains a tiny Jekyll site that uses the [Data Files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) to generate a long HTML page of certificates, split up using `page-break-after: always;`. `cd` into there, `jekyll serve`, then print to a PDF.
